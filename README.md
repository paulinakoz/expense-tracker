# Build Day - Expense Tracker 
I built a web application which allows a user to keep track of income and expenses. A user can add and remove items and save transactions to local storage. 

I also used Cypress to write a feature test for the main components wich I wanted to appear on the page. 

### Quickstart
1. Fork this repository
2. `git clone git@github.com:paulinakoz/expense-tracker.git`
3. `cd expense-tracker`
4. `npm install` to install project dependencies

### Running tests
```
npx cypress open
```

### Specifications
- Create a mock up of the apps design
- Decide on UI and functionality
- Display transaction items in DOM
- Show balance, expense and income totals
- Add new transation and reflect in total
- Delete items from DOM
